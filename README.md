**A Constellation of Connections**
Map synaptic protein data with Constellation. 

Constellation is a desktop GUI for running proteome & protein-distance analyses from a folder of exported analysis files plus an expansion factor spreadsheet. It provides a clean, fullscreen interface with optional Alignment, Angle, and Enrichment analyses.

**Created by: Rebecca E. Twilley**

## Features

- **Data Inputs**
  - Select a **Data Folder** (your exported analysis file from Imaris (`.xlsx .csv`), find template excel file in template folder)
  - Select an **Expansion Factor** Excel file (`.xlsx .csv`), find template excel file in template folder)

- **Analyses (Toggle On/Off)**
  - **Alignment analysis**
    - First set **protein locations** (presynaptic/postsynaptic; membrane/cytosol)
    - Choose the *Longest Protein Pair* from a dropdown (formulated after protein locations are set)
    - Set an **alignment tolerance**
  - **Angle analysis**
    - Pick **3 proteins (A, B, C)** to form a triangle
    - Set max angle thresholds at A/B/C (degrees)
  - **Enrichment analysis**
    - Set an enrichment cutoff (µm)

- **Parameters**
  - Number of proteins: **3 or 4**
  - Cluster distance cutoff (µm) (e.g., **0.3 µm = 300 nm**)

**Steps for Use**
  - Upload data folder containing Imaris derived excel files only.* Headers should be as per supplied template. Constellation will load excel files and read protein names. 
  - Upload expansion factor excel Headers should be a per supplied expansion_factor_template file.
  - Select the parameters you require for your analysis.
  - For Alignment Analysis: Select the location of each protein, then select which protein pair that will have the longest distance.
  - For Angle Analysis: Assign which proteins will be included in the angle analysis. Then put the angle threshold (degrees).
